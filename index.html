                <p> A web developer is a programmer who develops World Wide Web applications using a client server
                    model.
                    The applications typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python,
                    Node.js, Go or Java in the server, and http for communications between client and server. </p>

                <p>There are no formal educational or license requirements to become a web developer. However, many
                    colleges
                    and trade schools offer coursework in web development. There are also many tutorials and articles
                    which
